- 整合掉那些杂合无结尾无头绪的东西，最终留下的是有效果=简单且一刀切系统式的模型

- Be organized : so that when you are in a good frame of mind and in the flow, you aren’t slowed down by not finding the critical information you need to keep going.

- Managing your attention : Allcott talks about using attention management instead of time management. In other words, focusing your attention on the right things, because your attention span is far more limited than the time available in a day.

- Be Ninja Prepared :You eat good food, when you have good food in the fridge.

One of the common problems with trying to lead a healthier lifestyle is that we’re busy. It can be hard to find easy, convenient options that are also nutritious. When you’ve been working all day, it’s late and you’re tired your willpower is down and the propensity to succumb to brain zapping food is at an all-time high. Productivity Ninja preparedness...  It’s like giving a gift to your future self, having good food in when you get home late or packed in your work bag/desk if you’re not. Don’t leave your future self in the lurch, as you will be as busy that day as you are now. Gift your future self with better quality options to set yourself up for more energy and resilience.
